### Repo for DL Models trained on variety of simple problems:

This repository contains implementations of various machine learning models and data analysis techniques for different datasets.
Each directory corresponds to a dataset, providing scripts for data preprocessing, visualization, model training, and evaluation.

#### ðŸš€ Getting Started -> How to Run project:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone "https://github.com/koelinkrishh/Deep-Learning-Problems.git"
   cd "Deep-Learning-Problems/Vegetable Classifier"
   ```

2. **Activate the virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   ..\.venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set Up Kaggle API Key (Required for Dataset Downloading):**
   Each user must download their own kaggle.json file from Kaggle.
   Place this file in the Deep-Learning-Problems directory.

5. **Run the Project:**
   Go to the particular dataset directory and run the Juypter notebook on your local machine.


Each dataset has its own directory with detailed instructions in its README.md file.
You can run the provided Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts to train models and visualize results.
